## Validation Package for our Agility with Microservice Programming 2021 (AMP) paper "Towards Integrating Blockchains with Microservice Architecture Using Model-Driven Engineering"
### Content description
---
This repository contains the artifacts used during the different stages of our approach for the Integration of Blockchain with Microservice Architecture using Model-Driven Engineering, we link the repositories of the source code we used in the workflow down below. 

#### Artifacts of the 3 approach stages
For Stage 1, the folder [puls_lemma_models](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/xp2021/tree/master/puls_lemma_models) contains reconstructed LEMMA models from our case study in an Eclipse project, which can be imported to the prepared Eclipse instance with our plugins. 

The folder [de.fhdo.lemma.model_processing.code_generation.ethereum_generator](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/xp2021/tree/master/de.fhdo.lemma.model_processing.code_generation.ethereum_generator) and [de.fhdo.lemma.model_processing.code_generation.web3j_genlet](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/xp2021/tree/master/de.fhdo.lemma.model_processing.code_generation.web3j_genlet) contain the artifacts for the code generation process of Stage 2. 

For Stage 3, the folder [generated_code](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/xp2021/tree/master/generated_code) contains the generated source code from the different code generators. 

### Source Code

For replicating the LoC counting follow these steps:
1. To replicate the validation results mentioned in Section 4 of the paper, review or execute the scripts from the cloned [loc_count](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/SN2021/tree/master/loc_count) folder.
